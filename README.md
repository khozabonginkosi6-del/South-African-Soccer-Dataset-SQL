⚽ Soccer Analytics Case Study — Ketro SA Dataset
📌 Summary
This case study explores player and team performance using the ketro_sa_soccer_dataset_advanced dataset. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from raw data using SQL, focusing on player statistics, team dynamics, market value, and contract trends. The analysis supports decision-making in scouting, recruitment, and performance optimization.

🛠️ Tools Used
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) — for querying and data exploration

T-SQL — for data transformation, aggregation, and metric calculation

Power BI (planned) — for dashboard visualization and storytelling

Excel/VBA (optional) — for filter automation and UX enhancements

🔍 How the Case Study Was Done
The analysis was structured into 20 targeted SQL queries, each designed to answer a specific business question:

Explored dataset structure with the first 100 rows

Counted total players and listed all unique teams

Grouped players by team, nationality, marital status, and agent

Identified top 10 goal scorers and market value leaders

Calculated average salary, passing accuracy, height, and weight by group

Analyzed contract end dates and flagged upcoming expirations

Compared shot accuracy with goals to explore performance correlations

Computed goals per match ratios and combined goals + assists

Summarized injury status and positional metrics

📊 Key Insights
High-performing players show strong goal-to-match ratios and market value alignment

Team-level breakdowns reveal disparities in salary, assists, and player count

Nationality and agent analysis highlight recruitment patterns and representation gaps

Contract data shows a spike in expirations in 2026 — useful for renewal planning

Shot accuracy vs goals reveals performance clusters worth scouting deeper

Position-based metrics help identify physical profiles and tactical strengths

📈 Next Steps
Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize trends and drill into player profiles

Use slicers for team, position, nationality, and contract year

Add KPI cards for total goals, assists, market value, and player count

Integrate filters for injury status and agent representation

🙌 Reflection
This case study was a deep dive into sports analytics using SQL. It challenged me to think like a data strategist — not just querying data, but shaping it into insights that matter. I’m excited to take this further into dashboard design and storytelling.
